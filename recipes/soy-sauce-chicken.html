<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine sugar, soy sauce, water, garlic, and ginger into a large stockpot over medium heat; stir until sugar dissolves.</li>
    <li>Add chicken thighs and bring to a boil. Simmer, turning the chicken thighs with tongs every 5 minutes, until the sauce is a rich, brown glaze and the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove pot from the heat and let cool 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken thighs to a platter; sprinkle with chopped green onions.</li>
